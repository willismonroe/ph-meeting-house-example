    <h1>Quaker Meetings Houses of New England</h1>
    <p>
      This project seeks to collect information about historic meetings houses
      of the Society of Friends in New England between 1672 and 1850. It was
      created as an example research project to be used with a tutorial hosted
      by
      <i><a href="https://programminghistorian.org/">Programming Historian</a></i>. The data presented below was
      collected from a number of sources:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Benes, Peter. <i>Meetinghouses of Early New England</i> University of
        Massachusetts Press, 2012.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://preservation.ri.gov/">The Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://mhc-macris.net/#!/">Massachusetts Historical Commission</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each meeting house is presented with its initial year of construction,
      its location, whether or not it is still standing, and any links to
      relevant online resources.
